Description: Inspiration from Space Invaders we modified it into Marine Invaders so you are in a submarine in the ocean and you're shooting bullets at the marine aliens while they throw bombs at you. 

How to play:
1. press start/enter
2. Control the ship's movement along the x axis by moving your mouse
3. Click to fire
4. Don't get hit by the bullets as you only have 5 lives 
5. Have fun! Don't die.
